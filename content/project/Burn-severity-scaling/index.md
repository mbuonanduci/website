West of the Cascade Divide in Washington and northern Oregon ("western Cascadia"), moist coniferous forests are characterized by infrequent, typically high-severity stand-replacing fire with multi-century fire return intervals and fire events as large as one million hectares in size. As climate warms, the largest future increases in area burned may occur in ecosystems such as western Cascadia, where climate tends to be the limiting factor. To anticipate the ecological impacts of future increases in area burned in western Cascadia, understanding not only the relative likelihood of small/moderate versus very-large fires, but also the range of potential high-severity patch structure within those respective fire sizes, will be critical. This project will examine the spatial patterns of contemporary fires (1984-2020) that have occurred across the Northwest US, developing an *atlas* of spatial scaling laws that relate high-severity patch structure to overall fire size. We will then evaluate whether and where contemporary fires in western Cascadia fall within this atlas of spatial scaling laws. The objectives of this research are to increase our understanding of the natural range of variation in wildfire patch structure across western Cascadia, and also to help managers better prepare for wildfire in this region.
