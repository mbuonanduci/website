This [Science for Nature and People Partnership (SNAPP)](https://snappartnership.net/teams/salmon-forests-and-fire/) working group aims to improve the health and resilience of salmonids, forests, and the human communities that rely on them in wildfire-prone areas. The working group will combine research on forest management for wildfire resilience with salmonid restoration and apply this to local conservation efforts. The group will create a salmonid-fire-vegetation database to quantify fish-fire relationships, identify factors that support fish resilience to fire, and develop tools for integrating wildfire management with salmonid recovery. The group will also work to identify communities where managers can be engaged to adapt and apply this integrated framework to meet their needs.
