The title of my Master's thesis was "Modeling individual lodgepole pine mortality from mountain pine beetle outbreak in a spatially explicit framework". This research utilized a long-term monitoring dataset of over 9,000 individually measured and mapped trees in the Fraser Experimental Forest, CO, USA.
