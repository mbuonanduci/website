Hello! I am a Postdoctoral Researcher working jointly with The Nature Conservancy and the University of Washington. Broadly, I am interested in harnessing quantitative methods to address both basic and applied ecological questions. I completed my PhD in the Quantitative Ecology and Resource Management program at the University of Washington, working with Dr. Brian J. Harvey. My graduate research focused on understanding the causes and consequences of forest disturbances (primarily bark beetle outbreaks and wildfires) across a range of spatial scales. Currently, my postdoctoral research explores terrestrial-aquatic linkages in forest ecosystems. More specifically, I am working to better understand how forest management and wildfire affect Pacific salmon population health.
